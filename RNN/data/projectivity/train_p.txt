0 :: i challenge american businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work force .
1 :: since the industrial changes which have so enormously increased the productive power of mankind , they are no longer sufficient .
0 :: and for the millions of other americans who have no health insurance at all , this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach .
1 :: as one of our nation 's most outstanding leaders , it is appropriate that his birthday be commemorated as a national holiday .
0 :: it is the intent of this administration to move ahead with exploration , leasing , and production on those frontier areas of the outer continental shelf where the environmental risks are acceptable .
0 :: we will reward the work of millions of working poor americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you 've got a child in the house , you will no longer be in poverty .
0 :: we ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes .
0 :: that may not be popular with either party , but it happens to be the truth .
0 :: in working out this problem to any sound conclusion it is necessary to avoid putting the government into the business of production or marketing or attempting to enact legislation for the purpose of price fixing .
1 :: but that 's only a little more than half of what we sought .
0 :: we can see forward only dimly -- 1 year , 5 years , a generation perhaps .
1 :: it has been said that our best years are behind us .
0 :: tonight , i come before this house , and the american people , with an appeal for renewal .
0 :: such officer or employe owes the duty to the united states to guard carefully and not to divulge or in any manner use , prematurely , information which is accessible to the officer or employe by reason of his official position .
0 :: but we must find some place to begin .
1 :: in europe combined defense has become a reality .
0 :: that 's great .
1 :: they will furnish a satisfactory substitute , based on sound principle and actual successful trial in nearly all the countries of the world , for the system of government guaranty of deposits now being adopted in several western states , which with deference to those who advocate it seems to me to have in it the seeds of demoralization to conservative banking and certain financial disaster .
1 :: in the recent national election there was no substantial difference between the two great parties in respect to that national policy .
1 :: economic situation during the past 12 months we have suffered with other nations from economic depression .
0 :: the deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of our republic .
1 :: in addition adjusted service certificates have been issued to 3,433,300 veterans .
0 :: at the start of 2006 , more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations .
1 :: the nation should not ask for a reduction in allowances to men and dependents whose disabilities rise out of war service nor to those veterans with substantial service who have become totally disabled from non-war-connected causes and who are at the same time without other support .
0 :: fiscal restraint must be continued in the years ahead .
0 :: those messages will contain many recommendations .
1 :: the memory of those days of triumphant battle will go with these fortunate men to their graves ; and each will have his favorite memory .
0 :: we still have much to do .
0 :: and i know this about the american people : we welcome competition .
0 :: no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be imagined .
0 :: as we look around the country , many of our shortcomings stand out in bold relief .
0 :: we must achieve a more rigorous administration of our development assistance , with larger roles for private investors , for other industrialized nations , and for international agencies and for the recipient nations themselves .
0 :: and tonight , i 'd like to talk about how together , we can deliver on that promise .
0 :: i also renew my recommendation that the congress pass a law regulating cold storage as it is regulated , for example , by the laws of the state of new jersey , which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage , prescribe the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period , and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt .
0 :: to increase taxation for purposes of construction work defeats its own purpose , as such taxes directly diminish employment in private industry .
0 :: legislation should be enacted at the present session of the congress for the thirteenth census .
0 :: the only efficient use for the navy is for offense .
1 :: this reduction of 86 million dollars is in large part accounted for by elimination of the wartime flax production incentive project and other nonrecurring items ; the proposed reduction in normal activities is less than 33 million dollars .
0 :: and millions of american workers -- whose jobs depend on the sale or the transportation or the distribution of exports or imports , or whose jobs will be endangered by the movement of our capital to europe , or whose jobs can be maintained only in an expanding economy -- these millions of workers in your home states and mine will see their real interests sacrificed .
1 :: we created the regulatory analysis review group in the white house to analyze the most costly proposed new rules and find ways to improve them .
1 :: if all of the republics to the south of us will only grow as those to which i allude have already grown , all need for us to be the especial champions of the doctrine will disappear , for no stable and growing american republic wishes to see some great non-american military power acquire territory in its neighborhood .
1 :: we will understand the importance of this best if we look back into history .
1 :: but one-third of the deficit is due to the necessary tax cuts that i 've proposed .
0 :: private investment , over half of it by railways , may approach 1,150 million dollars .
0 :: when budget savings and sound governmental financing are assured , tax burdens should be reduced so that taxpayers may spend their own money in their own way .
0 :: this is probably temporary , but it is none the less acute .
0 :: no one point of our policy , foreign or domestic , is more important than this to the honor and material welfare , and above all to the peace , of our nation in the future .
0 :: it is urgent that the banks be supported so as to stabilize the market values of their bonds and thus secure capital for the farmers at low rates , that they may continue their services to agriculture and that they may meet the present situation with consideration to the farmers .
0 :: the expenditure of public money for the performance of such necessary functions of government is certainly warranted , nor is it necessary to dwell upon the incidental benefits to our foreign commerce , to the shipbuilding industry , and to ship owning and navigation which will accompany the discharge of these urgent public duties , though they , too , should have weight .
0 :: syria still allows its territory and parts of lebanon to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region .
1 :: we can press on with economic growth and reforms in education and medicare , or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions .
1 :: this year , the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60 , including two of my dad 's favorite people , me and president clinton .
1 :: last week , the supreme court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests including foreign corporations to spend without limit in our elections .
1 :: japan 's scheme of conquest goes back half a century .
1 :: international commission of jurists in pursuance of the convention of august 23 , 1906 , signed at the third pan american conference , held at rio de janeiro , the international commission of jurists met at that capital during the month of last june .
0 :: it seems to me that it might be the part of wisdom , therefore , before further legislation in this field is attempted , to look at the whole problem of coordination and efficiency in the full light of a fresh assessment of circumstance and opinion , as a guide to dealing with the several parts of it .
1 :: inflation has driven up home prices , operating costs and interest rates .
1 :: farmers ' savings are the largest in history .
0 :: this year i will be asking congress for the means to do what must be done for that great and good cause .
0 :: i therefore suggest that an inquiry be directed especially to the effect of the workings of the antitrust laws in these particular fields to determine if these evils can be remedied without sacrifice of the fundamental purpose of these laws .
1 :: we shall continue our efforts for world economic recovery , because world prosperity is the only sure foundation of a permanent peace .
1 :: i particularly direct your attention to the very practical plans which the secretary of the interior has developed in his annual report and before your committees for the reclamation of arid , swamp , and cutover lands which might , if the states were willing and able to cooperate , redeem some three hundred million acres of land for cultivation .
0 :: the harbor of san juan in porto rico should be dredged and improved .
0 :: by special message on january 24 , i shall propose a coordinated program to strengthen and improve existing health services .
0 :: i infer from your dispatch that both parties attempt to heed the warning , but that in the strain and exigency of the contest wild bullets still find their way into douglas .
0 :: i will , therefore , submit to the congress a new comprehensive farm program -- tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each crop to the long-range needs of the sixties -- and designed to prevent chaos in the sixties with a program of common sense .
1 :: as a people , we are achieving ever higher standards of living -- earning more , producing more , consuming more , building more and investing more than ever before .
1 :: we appointed the national crime commission to study crime in america and to recommend the best ways to carry that attack forward .
0 :: america and afghanistan are now allies against terror .
0 :: we are fighting today for security , for progress , and for peace , not only for ourselves but for all men , not only for one generation but for all generations .
0 :: in washington to-day are met the delegates of the central american nations , gathered at the table of international understanding , to stabilize their republics and remove every vestige of disagreement .
0 :: these are steps in the continuing effort to eliminate inter-racial difficulty .
1 :: in addition , reported cases of measles and mumps are at their lowest levels ever .
0 :: if it prove impracticable to enact a law for the encouragement of shipping generally , then at least provision should be made for better communication with south america , notably for fast mail lines to the chief south american ports .
1 :: democrats and republicans have supported it before .
1 :: these laws have been , are being , and will be , thoroughly enforced .
1 :: many businesses have shuttered .
0 :: so all of us , not just as parents , but all of us in our other roles -- our media , our schools , our teachers , our communities , our churches and synagogues , our businesses , our governments -- all of us have a responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most of their lives and their god-given capacities .
0 :: abroad , there is the continuing communist threat to the freedom of berlin , an explosive situation in laos , the problems caused by communist penetration of cuba , as well as the many problems connected with the development of the new nations in africa .
1 :: with courage -- and a tie-breaking vote by the vice president -- the senate faced down the gun lobby , stood up for the american people , and passed this legislation .
1 :: for too long our culture has said , `` if it feels good , do it . ''
0 :: indeed , no laws , no initiatives , no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges i 've outlined tonight .
0 :: this is the first state of the union carried live in video over the internet , but we 've only begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution that should become the modern birthright of every citizen .
0 :: it is time we made that possibility a reality .
0 :: we need less bureaucracy .
1 :: education and science have made further advances .
0 :: by the year 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be in health care .
0 :: we will ask the congress to help carry out those parts of the program which require legislation .
1 :: as a people , we had too many visions -- and too little vision .
1 :: so let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight .
0 :: this production of ours in the united states must be raised far above present levels , even though it will mean the dislocation of the lives and occupations of millions of our own people .
1 :: we 've got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kids , help them with their homework , pass along the values we had as children .
1 :: our record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history but an economic and social revolution of hope based on work , incentives , growth , and opportunity ; a revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77-percent increase in charitable giving ; a revolution that at a critical moment in world history reclaimed and restored the american dream .
1 :: i recommend more adequate provision than has been made heretofore for the work of the department of state .
1 :: i 'm pleased to report we have also met that goal two full years ahead of schedule .
0 :: i also hope before this session is over to transmit to the congress a series of proposals to strengthen the antimonopoly laws , to assist small business , and to encourage the growth of new enterprises .
0 :: one-fifth of our families now have average annual incomes of less than $ 850 .
0 :: i know their are differences among us about the impact and the effects of a capital gains incentive .
0 :: rather , there must be a many-sided assault on the stubborn problems of surpluses , prices , costs , and markets ; and a steady , persistent , imaginative advance in the relationship between farmers and their government .
1 :: time and distance from the events of september the 11th will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons .
1 :: it is made my duty by law , whenever the estimates of expenditure exceed the estimates of revenue , to call the attention of the congress to the fact and suggest any means of meeting the deficiency that it may be wise or possible for me to suggest .
1 :: we have successfully fought against red lining and housing discrimination .
1 :: and i have notified the olympic committee that with soviet invading forces in afghanistan , neither the american people nor i will support sending an olympic team to moscow .
0 :: but your efforts will come to nothing unless it reaches the people .
1 :: since the founding of the commission there has never been a time of equal length in which anything like so many reduced tariffs have been put into effect .
0 :: the rapid growth of our foreign trade makes it of the utmost importance that governmental agencies through which that trade is to be aided and protected should possess a high degree of efficiency .
0 :: no less important than the level of interest rates paid on the debt is the distribution of its ownership .
1 :: these heroic men can never be paid in money for the service they patriotically rendered the nation .
0 :: to ensure that the necessary economic development goes forward , the congress must continue to provide strong support for the udag program and the programs for the economic development administration .
0 :: but of one thing i am sure : something must be done , and done soon .
0 :: our people , moreover , do not wait to be coached and led .
0 :: there should be regulation by the national government of the great interstate corporations , including a simple method of account keeping , publicity , supervision of the issue securities , abolition of rebates , and of special privileges .
1 :: that progress has speeded internal development and has changed world relationships so fast that we must realize the fact of a new era .
1 :: in like fashion from 1815 to 1914 -- ninety-nine years -- no single war in europe or in asia constituted a real threat against our future or against the future of any other american nation .
1 :: this method of action often resulted in badly chosen boundaries and consequent injustice to settlers and others .
1 :: the triumph of democratic ideas in eastern europe and latin america , and the continuing struggle for freedom elsewhere around the world all confirm the wisdom of our nation 's founders .
0 :: but remember this : the overwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided by relatives and neighbors and churches and community groups .
0 :: let us so conduct ourselves that two centuries from now , another congress and another president , meeting in this chamber as we are meeting , will speak of us with pride , saying that we met the test and preserved for them in their day the sacred flame of liberty -- this last , best hope of man on earth .
0 :: but where our interests and our values are at stake , and where we can make a difference , america must lead .
0 :: the most serious is the destruction by the rinderpest of more than 75 per cent of the draught cattle , because it will take several years of breeding to restore the necessary number of these indispensable aids to agriculture .
0 :: indeed , the greater part of the task must be performed by individual efforts under our system of free enterprise .
1 :: the sale of hard drugs is tragically on the increase again .
0 :: the communist economic offensive is under way .
0 :: we must continue our program to help our indian citizens improve their lot and make their full contribution to national life .
0 :: we do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap labor ; we wish a healthy american community of men who themselves till the farms they own .
0 :: yet we must not delude ourselves that safety necessarily increases as expenditures for military research or forces in being go up .
1 :: now , i must turn to the debit side of the ledger for the past year .
0 :: the insurance companies , which are practically mutual benefit societies -- especially helpful to men of moderate means -- represent accumulations of capital which are among the largest in this country .
1 :: we increased our fighting force to its present strength tonight of 190,000 men .
0 :: beyond 2014 , america 's commitment to a unified and sovereign afghanistan will endure , but the nature of our commitment will change .
0 :: we must maintain a strong and ready military .
0 :: but there should be a comprehensive law enacted with the object of working a threefold improvement over our present system .
0 :: our economy is measured in numbers and statistics .
0 :: taxpayers should n't pay for the cost of lung cancer , emphysema , and other smoking-related illnesses , the tobacco companies should .
0 :: i believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform are a sure path to increased popularity for republicans and democrats alike because it says to the voters back home , `` this is your house .
0 :: the administrator of veterans ' affairs advises that a further appropriation of $ 200,000,000 is required at once to meet the obligations made necessary by existing legislation .
0 :: we are prepositioning more heavy equipment in europe to help us cope with attacks with little warning , and greatly strengthening our airlift and sealift capabilities .
0 :: the maintenance of international peace is a matter in which we are deeply and unselfishly concerned .
0 :: action should be begun forthwith , during the present session of the congress , for the improvement of our inland waterways -- action which will result in giving us not only navigable but navigated rivers .
0 :: to relieve the critical shortage of doctors and dentists -- and this is a matter which should concern us all -- and expand research , i urge action to aid medical and dental colleges and scholarships and to establish new national institutes of health .
0 :: this year , i ask you to make it three in a row .
1 :: it must be done -- and we have undertaken to do it .
1 :: through hot wars and cold , through recession and prosperity , through the ages of the atom and outer space , the american people have never faltered and their faith has never flagged .
1 :: extensive sales of forged certificates of naturalization have been discovered , as well as many cases of naturalization secured by perjury and fraud ; and in addition , instances have accumulated showing that many courts issue certificates of naturalization carelessly and upon insufficient evidence .
0 :: our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
0 :: we will not fail them .
0 :: in these days , when we should be making progress in court procedure , such a conformity statute makes the federal method too dependent upon the action of state legislatures .
0 :: that 's right -- eight years .
1 :: he never spoke about himself .
0 :: i take leave to beg that the whole energy and attention of the senate be concentrated upon it till the matter is successfully disposed of .
0 :: we believe that a person should get what he works for -- and that those who can , should work for what they get .
1 :: aided by this humanitarian program , total agricultural exports have grown from $ 2.8 billion in 1953 to an average of about $ 4 billion annually for the past three years .
1 :: the russian people have been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the german people in the dark , and the poison has been administered by the very same hand .
0 :: i am requesting , therefore , that the congress once again extend the defense production act .
1 :: in this direct connection , i would call your attention to my recommendations on august 8th , pointing out legislative measures which would be effective in controlling and bringing down the present cost of living , which contributes so largely to this unrest .
1 :: to sustain and extend the best that has emerged in america , i invite you to join the new usa freedom corps .
0 :: provision should be made for extending coverage credit to veterans for the period of their service in the armed forces .
1 :: in particular , the federal government must be in a position to assist in the building of new cities and the rebuilding of old ones .
0 :: we will seek early ratification of the treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide .
1 :: for seven years , we have worked hard to improve our schools , with opportunity and responsibility : investing more , but demanding more in return .
0 :: but far more important , in the long run , is the work americans are doing in india to help the indian farmers themselves raise more grain .
0 :: in yemen , somalia , iraq , and mali , we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks .
0 :: it is not intended thereby to prevent the accumulation of large capital in business enterprises in which such a combination can secure reduced cost of production , sale , and distribution .
1 :: this is nearly the amount of the total cost of the national government , exclusive of the post office , before we entered the last war .
1 :: the establishment of the mortgage-discount banks herein referred to will also contribute to further reserve strength in the banks without inflation .
1 :: with the twofold purpose of strengthening the whole financial structure and of arriving eventually at a medium of exchange which over the years will have less variable purchasing and debt paying power for our people than that of the past , i have used the authority granted me to purchase all american-produced gold and silver and to buy additional gold in the world markets .
0 :: beyond the relief feeding period , there will still be substantial foreign outlets for our farm commodities .
0 :: the new administration should continue to work to eliminate transportation bottlenecks that impede our access to foreign markets .
0 :: today , there are 122 .
0 :: the soviets are , in short , waging total cold war .
0 :: we must explore every reasonable prospect for meeting our energy needs when our current domestic reserves of oil and natural gas begin to dwindle in the next decade .
1 :: many centuries would have to pass before soil would again collect , or could be made to collect , in sufficient quantity once more to support the old-time forest growth .
0 :: but from another point of view i believe that it is necessary to say plainly what we here at the seat of action consider the war to be for and what part we mean to play in the settlement of its searching issues .
0 :: this legislation is the right thing for america .
1 :: the new m-x missile program to enhance our land-based intercontinental ballistic missile force continues to make progress .
0 :: in our relations with the world we shall follow the example of andrew jackson who said : `` i intend to ask for nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong . ''
1 :: legislation to this end has been recommended by the attorney general and should be enacted .
0 :: we desire peace with all the world , but perhaps most of all with the other peoples of the american continent .
0 :: you know my views on this .
0 :: substantial progress is being made upon the projects of the upper missouri , upper mississippi , etc .
1 :: the united nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job , finding and destroying more of iraq 's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war .
0 :: because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice , we need to make sure americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice .
1 :: last august the united nations general assembly , by an overwhelming vote , approved a disarmament plan that we and our allies sincerely believed to be fair and practical .
1 :: inflation remained in double digits , and government spending increased at an annual rate of 17 percent .
1 :: i in the treasury department the efficiency and economy work has been kept steadily up .
1 :: together we have made a new beginning , but we have only begun .
0 :: governments which rest upon the consent of the governed do not wage war on their neighbors .
0 :: but enterprise and ambition are qualities which no government can supply .
0 :: the present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not just .
1 :: the world also thinks of us as a land which has never enslaved anyone and which is animated by humane ideals .
0 :: rapid deployment forces we are systematically enhancing our ability to respond rapidly to non-nato contingencies wherever required by our commitments or when our vital interests are threatened .
0 :: i see you .
0 :: well , maybe you 're right .
0 :: we believe , however , that the rules of procedure in the federal courts with respect to the issuance of the writ of injunction should be more accurately defined by statute , and that no injunction or temporary restraining order should be issued without notice , except where irreparable injury would result from delay , in which case a speedy hearing thereafter should be granted . ''
0 :: other billions go for research , development , test and evaluation of new weapons systems .
0 :: i will recommend measures to eliminate certain payments in the veterans ' services .
1 :: the legislators and executives are chosen to represent the people in enacting and administering the laws .
0 :: nevertheless , there is an evident and constantly growing feeling among our people that the time is rapidly approaching when our system of revenue legislation must be revised .
0 :: however , our farm legislation is still not adequate .
1 :: and let me add here : so many of our greatest statesmen have reminded us that spiritual values alone are essential to our nation 's health and vigor .
0 :: we will not rest until this enemy has been defeated .
0 :: the question is how justice among nations is best achieved .
0 :: but our currency system is imperfect , and it is earnestly to be hoped that the currency commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects .
1 :: the interstate commerce commission has made important and far-reaching recommendations upon the whole subject , which i commend to the early consideration of the congress .
0 :: but we also do it because it is right .
1 :: but the debate is settled .
0 :: careful budget policy should be supplemented by other measures designed to reduce inflation at lower cost in lost output and employment .
1 :: we have been proceeding under the act of congress that contemplates the establishment of trade routes to be ultimately transferred to private ownership and operation .
1 :: there has been a change of sovereigns in siam and the american minister at bangkok was accredited in a special capacity to represent the united states at the coronation ceremony of the new king .
1 :: this formula was based on the policy of the united states that people be permitted to choose their own form of government by their own freely expressed choice without interference from any foreign source .
1 :: as a young girl , denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice .
0 :: good will prevails in our relations with the german empire .
0 :: we have two choices .
0 :: mr. speaker , i look forward to working with you .
0 :: tell it to the 81 million americans with those preexisting conditions ; those folks are paying more or they ca n't get insurance at all or they ca n't ever change their jobs because they or someone in their family has one of those preexisting conditions .
1 :: within the navy department itself the needs of the service have brought about a system under which the duties of a general staff are partially performed ; for the bureau of navigation has under its direction the war college , the office of naval intelligence , and the board of inspection , and has been in close touch with the general board of the navy .
0 :: we must continue to assure them the opportunity to earn a fair reward .
0 :: the large indian schools situated remote from any indian reservation do a special and peculiar work of great importance .
0 :: i will take actions to reduce undue hardships on any geographical region .
0 :: probably no other great nation in the world is so anxious for peace as we are .
0 :: let us weave these sturdy threads into a new american community that once more stand strong against the forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to walk into a better tomorrow .
0 :: i wo n't even touch that .
1 :: responsibility and crime crime in america has dropped for the past seven years -- the longest decline on record , thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police , sensible gun safety laws , and effective prevention .
1 :: this preventive measure is of such great importance that i have recommended for it an increased appropriation .
0 :: they have few or no high pressure representatives at the capitol .
0 :: in addition , i recommended insurance benefits to replace part of the earnings lost through temporary sickness and permanent disability .
0 :: third , we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidies .
0 :: the time has come when a more complete program can be formulated and more satisfactorily administered for their treatment and training , and i earnestly urge that the congress give the matter its early consideration .
1 :: a beginning has already been made for such supervision by the establishment of the bureau of corporations .
1 :: even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters , the american people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world .
1 :: first in importance in the american scene has been the inspiring proof of the great qualities of our fighting men .
0 :: i recommend that you give careful and early consideration to this subject , and if you find the opinion of the interstate commerce commission justified , that you amend the law so as to obviate the evil disclosed .
0 :: as things are now the average soldier has far too much labor of a nonmilitary character to perform .
0 :: by strangling competition , monopolistic activity prevents or deters investment in new or expanded production facilities .
0 :: shall we say to the farmer , `` the prices for your products are in part restored .
0 :: now , the first $ 24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free .
0 :: and it 's true , there 's no quick fix , as i said , to instantly end the tragic pain of unemployment .
0 :: much of it can not be used to advantage unless it is fenced , for fencing is the only way by which to keep in check the owners of nomad flocks which roam hither and thither , utterly destroying the pastures and leaving a waste behind so that their presence is incompatible with the presence of home-makers .
0 :: he is ours .
0 :: the competition for jobs is real .
0 :: mr. president , mr. speaker , members of the house and the senate , distinguished americans here as visitors in this chamber , as am i .
0 :: we also need to improve the means for getting farm products into markets and into the hands of consumers .
0 :: the passage of the bill would not entail a dollar 's expense upon the government at this time or in the future until war comes .
0 :: and , my friends , that will change the face and future of america .
1 :: through these means the 700,000 people in the flooded areas have been adequately supported .
0 :: the battle of the atlantic -- like all campaigns in this war -- demands eternal vigilance .
0 :: but first we must make choices .
1 :: this significant recognition of merit in competition with the chosen exhibits of all other nations and at the hands of juries almost wholly made up of representatives of france and other competing countries is not only most gratifying , but is especially valuable , since it sets us to the front in international questions of supply and demand , while the large proportion of awards in the classes of art and artistic manufactures afforded unexpected proof of the stimulation of national culture by the prosperity that flows from natural productiveness joined to industrial excellence .
0 :: discrimination against any american is un-american .
1 :: we have answered by continuing to help farmers obtain electric power , until today nearly 90 per cent of our farms have power line electric service .
0 :: it seems to me that the national reserve association meets the same objection in a similar way ; that is , by giving to each bank , state and national , in accordance with its size , a certain share in the stock of the reserve association , nontransferable and only to be held by the bank while it performs its functions as a partner in the reserve association .
0 :: they halt or hamper the movement for securing better and more equitable conditions of labor .
0 :: the givers and takers of bribes stand on an evil pre-eminence of infamy .
1 :: with tax relief , overtime will no longer be overtax time for the waitress .
1 :: we have proposed disarmament .
1 :: the journey from pekin to jehol shows in melancholy fashion how the soil has been washed away from whole valleys , so that they have been converted into deserts .
0 :: to these ends , efficient planning and execution of the nation 's public works require both the coordination of federal activities and effective cooperation with state and local governments .
0 :: there should be publicity of the accounts of common carriers ; no common carrier engaged in interstate business should keep any books or memoranda other than those reported pursuant to law or regulation , and these books or memoranda should be open to the inspection of the government .
1 :: in this period no new nation has become communist , and the unity of the communist empire has begun to crumble .
0 :: our immediate problem is the increase of employment for the next six months , and new plans which do not produce such immediate result or which extend commitments beyond this period are not warranted .
1 :: the social and economic forces which have been mismanaged abroad until they have resulted in revolution , dictatorship and war are the same as those which we here are struggling to adjust peacefully at home .
1 :: they are among the many who in this century , far from home , have died for our country .

0 :: businesses plan to invest almost $ 100 billion in new factories that use natural gas .
0 :: immediate passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less necessary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which i refer , because at least two years will elapse before another election in which federal offices are to be filled ; but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the present method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under recent observation , and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience ; and a delay would have the further very serious disadvantage of postponing action until another election was at hand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it .

0 :: let 's simplify the system and let a small-business owner file based on her actual bank statement , instead of the number of accountants she can afford .

0 :: i strongly urge the congress to pass these measures to help create the productive , permanent jobs in the private economy that are so essential for our future .

1 :: that has created a very large portion of our treasury deficits .
0 :: now america is embracing a new ethic and a new creed , `` let 's roll . ''
